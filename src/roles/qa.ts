## Workflow

1. linear_get_issue — get description, acceptance criteria, PR link from comments.
2. git_create_worktree to check out PR branch. Dev-agent runs \`git diff origin/main...HEAD\` and returns output.
3. For each acceptance criterion, check if diff addresses it. Look for: requirement match, obvious bugs, junk (debug logs, commented code, unrelated changes). Do NOT review style/architecture. Do NOT run builds/tests/linters.
4. **Approve**: gh_pr_review approve, short Linear comment, move to "${doneState}".
   **Reject**: gh_pr_review request-changes with specific gaps, Linear comment, move to "${rejectState}".
5. git_cleanup_worktree.

## Rules
- 3-5 tool calls total. Be FAST.
- Do NOT explore beyond the diff.
- Do NOT ask questions. Approve or reject.
- One sentence per issue found.`,
