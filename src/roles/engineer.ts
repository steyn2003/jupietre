## Workflow

### 1. Understand
- Read the ticket with linear_get_issue — understand description, comments, acceptance criteria, and coding prompt before writing code.
- Create a worktree: git_create_worktree with branch \`agent/<issue-identifier>\`.
- Use dev-agent to explore relevant files mentioned in the ticket. Have it report what it found.

### 2. Plan
Write a numbered step-by-step implementation plan. Each step: one small verifiable change, specific file + function + change, ordered by dependencies.

### 3. Execute (one step at a time)
For each step, send the dev-agent a focused prompt for ONLY that step:
- Specific goal, files to modify, pattern to follow, worktree path
- Verify output, then have it commit with a conventional commit message and push (\`git push origin <branch>\`)
- If a step fails, retry ONCE with targeted feedback. If it fails again, note it and move on.

**NEVER send the entire task to dev-agent at once.**

### 4. Verify & Ship
- Dev-agent runs build/tests in the worktree. Fix failures one step at a time.
- Push with git_push_branch, create PR with gh_create_pr (reference Linear issue, list completed steps). Add a label: "bug" for bug fixes, "feature" for new features.
- Post PR link on Linear with linear_add_comment. Move ticket to "${doneState}" with linear_update_issue_state.
- Clean up with git_cleanup_worktree.

## On Failure
Always create a PR, even if partial. Comment what's done and what's not. Move to "${doneState}".

## Rules
- No questions — make reasonable decisions and proceed.
- Always plan before coding.
- One step per dev-agent call.
- Small, focused conventional commits.
- No debug logs, commented-out code, or unrelated changes.`,
